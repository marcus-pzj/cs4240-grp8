## Project Description

A Mo(ve)ment in Time is a photo exhibition featuring our 21 CFA Arts Excellence groups.  

Photos of our groups will be on display, and using an AR App, the public can scan the photos on their phone, and the photos will "come to life" to show a 30sec to 1min video clip to show our groups in performance.  

This exhibition looks back to a time when we could perform together, as well as looking forward to when we can reunite and perform together again.

## How to Use

1. Scan the photo of a group using the phone's camera.
2. A video of the group's performance will begin playing over the photo.
3. The name of the performing group will be visible on the screen.
4. A video progress bar will also be visible, showing the total duration of the video. The playhead marks your current position on the timeline.
5. The video can be paused/resumed using the play/pause button.
6. The video will disappear once the photo is moved out of the camera's frame.
7. Repeat Steps 1-6 for other photos.

## Brief Plan of Extension

Our group came up with an idea of creating a Digital Passport web application for visitors in the photo exhibition.
This Digital Passport allows visitors to check-in at the various exhibit landmarks within the exhibiton.
When a visitor scans a photo, the associated video will be added to their video collection.
Visitors will also be able to see his/her unvisited exhibits.

The Digital Passport aims to serve three main purposes:

1. To motivate visitors to view all the photos in the exhibition to complete their video collection.
2. To assist visitors in navigating within the exhibiton as they can find out their unvisited exhibits.
3. To provide meaningful takeaways from the exhibiton as they get to review the videos in their video collection
